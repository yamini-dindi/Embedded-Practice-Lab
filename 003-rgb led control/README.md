## RGB LED Control Using Serial Monitor Input

**Goal:** Control RGB LEDs by entering characters through the Serial Monitor.

**Input via Serial Monitor:**
- 'r' → Red LED glows
- 'g' → Green LED glows
- 'b' → Blue LED glows

**Logic Implemented:**
- Conditional statements (if–else)
- Switch–case statement

**Components:** Arduino Uno, Red LED, Green LED, Blue LED, resistors

**Learned:** Serial communication, character input handling, decision-making logic, RGB LED control
